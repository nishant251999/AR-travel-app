**Live it**

Sightseeing can become drab and boring when the guides tell us about events and the socio-economic importance in history of the place we visit. At the end of the day, we take away with us a bleak memory of innumerable facts that was told and fail to really connect with what was told to us. What if we get to travel in time and see the place just the way it was as our guide describes it?

Something that will make us looks forward to such trips and makes this experience etched in our memory forever?

This is the real objective of our project, to make it real for people who wish to live the beauty they see around and we build an AR app for the same.

**How does this work?**

Once the user installs our android application on his/her phone, all he has to do is to open the app and press the SCAN button.

As soon as he does that, the mobile camera opens and the user has to scan the monument/building in front. (We have taken an image for now but the app will work the same with real monument as well or even better)

The user also has the option to explore more about the monument, by pressing the info button which gives the user a brief monument tour and a video button which shows a mesmerizing video associated with the monument.
