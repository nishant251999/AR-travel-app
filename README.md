Project Name: Live it Project Details:

Sightseeing can become drab and boring when the guides tell us about events and the socio-economic importance in history of the place we visit. At the end of the day, we take away with us a bleak memory of innumerable facts that was told and fail to really connect with what was told to us. What if we get to travel in time and see the place just the way it was as our guide describes it?

Something that will make us looks forward to such trips and makes this experience etched in our memory forever?

This is the real objective of our project, to make it real for people who wish to live the beauty they see around and we build an AR app for the same.

Once a monument is scanned with the help of our app, the user gets to see an augmented version of the same, with various effects and important messages. The app also has an option to know more about the monument in the frame and the user can also see an amazing video associated with it.

Once the campaign is successfully over, we plan to build on the recommendations given by the respected jury and to also add more and more monuments and sightseeing places to our database so that people from all over the globe can experience this wonder.
